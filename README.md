# Interface-Oriented-Programming---Objc
An IOP demo written by objc

1. Public Mehtods in base class are un-overridable (Common Agreement among developers in the team).
2. No empty methods in base class.
3. Overridable methods are all defined in the interfaces(protocols).
4. Base class controls when and how to call optional methods in the interfaces. The optional methods' name are not necessary as same as the caller methods.
